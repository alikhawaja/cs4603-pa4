# CS4603 PA4 — Document Analyst (Student Submission)

> This is your **submission file**. `README.md` is the assignment spec — this document is where you write up your work.
>
> - Document how to set up, run, and deploy your Document Analyst so a TA can reproduce your results.
> - **Answer every ANALYSIS QUESTION** from the assignment in the sections below.
> - Replace every `TODO` before submitting.
> - Keep it self-contained: a reader should be able to follow this file top-to-bottom —
>   setup → ingest → run → deploy → results — without opening the assignment spec.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your values
```

## Running locally

TODO: how to ingest the corpus, run the graph in `pa4.ipynb`, and test queries.

> **Example of the level of detail expected** (replace with your own steps/values):
>
> 1. **Ingest the corpus** (run once, from a Databricks notebook):
>    ```python
>    from rag.ingest import ingest
>    ingest(spark, volume_path="/Volumes/main/default/pa4/annual_report.pdf")
>    ```
>    This parses the PDF, chunks it into `main.default.ali_analyst_chunks`, and syncs the
>    Vector Search index `main.default.ali_analyst_index`. Wait until the index is `READY`.
>
> 2. **Build and run the graph** in `pa4.ipynb`:
>    ```python
>    from agent.graph import build_graph
>    graph = build_graph()          # uses config.py + rag/store.py + the MCP server
>    result = graph.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user",
>              "content": "What was the net revenue in 2023?"}]})
>    print(result["messages"][-1].content)
>    ```
>
> 3. **Test queries I ran** (retrieval-only, computation-only, combined):
>    | Query | Answer produced |
>    |-------|-----------------|
>    | "What was the net income in 2023?" | ¥1.11 trillion [source: annual_report.pdf, p.4] |
>    | "What is 15% of 2.4 billion?" | 360 million |
>    | "What was 2023 revenue, and its value after 10% growth?" | ¥16.91T → ¥18.60T (16.91 × 1.10) |
